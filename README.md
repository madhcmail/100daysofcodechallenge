Day 27: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I worked on some code challenges related to itertools module.Here are the code challenges\
Day 28: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I learned about four different ways of passing arguments to  functions.https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/style/#function-arguments \
Day 29: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I started learning about decorators in python and the syntax of decorators. Will learn more about these in next couple of days. \
Day 30: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I learned about Types of decorators like basic decorators, decorator function with single parameter, multiple parameters and how to pass a parameter to decorator. \
Day 31: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I learned about how to stack multiple decorators, and how to undecorate or use the original function from a decorated one. \
Day 32: Today I followed a link on decorators https://gist.github.com/Zearin/2f40b7b9cfc51132851a and solved https://codechalleng.es/bites/22/ \
Day 33: Today I learned about how to handle errors in python and did some parctice on error handling with try and except blocks.\
Day 34:#100DaysOfCode progress: Today I learned about logging in python and how to log different levels of information using python logging module. \
Day 35:#100DaysOfCode progress: Today I learned more about logging and practiced on loggers, file handlers and formatters \
Day 36: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I worked on solving a code challenge in hacker rank
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/validating-credit-card-number/problem \
Day 37: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I started learning about CSV module by parsing through a US weather dataset from fivethirtyeight github repository(https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data). Will continue working on this dataset on how to convert the csv data in to some usable form and find answers to some questions like top hottest, coldest, wettest days. 
Day 38:#100DaysOfCode progress: Today I continued my work on the US weather dataset that I picked from FiveThirtyEight GitHub repository(https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data). I wrote a function to convert the string data to the respective data types which will be used later for the analysis purpose. Also, I converted the dictionary to a named tuple which will help to work with the data in a more nicer way.\
Day 39: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I completed my code on the US weather dataset that I picked from FiveThirtyEight GitHub repository(https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data). I was able to parse the datset,convert into usable format and then find answers to the top 5 hottest days, coldest and wettest days. By analyzing this dataset, I am able to understand the CSV module, importance of named tuples and __file__ dunder variable.\
Day 40: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I took one more dataset from the same FiveThirtyEight GitHub repository(https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data) called "thanksgiving-2015-poll-data.csv". The goal is to analyze this dataset and predict the menu items  at an (American) Thanksgiving meal for a random region in the US.D1: I parsed though the dataset using CSV module and created a named tuple with the required columns for the analysis.\
Day41: #100DaysOfCode progress/D2: Today I continued my coding on dataset "thanksgiving-2015-poll-data.csv". Converting the CSV data into a usable format. Wrote functions to get the unique available regions, income ranges so that users can choose while providing their input.\
Day42: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I completed my work on dataset "thanksgiving-2015-poll-data.csv" which I picked from FiveThirtyEight GitHub repository(https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data). The goal of this dataset is predict the Thanksgiving menu (Main dish and at-least 5 side dishes) based on the attributes that user provides( US region and Income range). D3: I have created the solution for the problem statement but I figured out I can improve my script, make it more efficient and reusable. I will refactor the code tomorrow.\
Day43: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I have refactored my code written on dataset "thanksgiving-2015-poll-data.csv" which I picked from FiveThirtyEight GitHub repository(https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data). The goal of this dataset is predict the Thanksgiving menu (Main dish and at-least 5 side dishes) based on the attributes that user provides( US region and Income range). \
Day44:#100DaysOfCode progress: Today I started learning a new python module Json and how to parse the data using json methods  loads() and dumps().\
Day45:#100DaysOfCode progress: Today I continued my learning and coding on parsing the nested structures in a json file. Tried practicing different methods, load(),loads(),dump(),dumps().\
Day46:#100DaysOfCode progress: Today I did coding by solving the below code challenge in hacker rank. Here is my today's commit https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/validate-list-of-email-address-with-filter/problem \
Day47: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I did work on Json search based APIs. I did use a restful moviedb search service api and try to parse though it and list down the titles and imdb_scores.
