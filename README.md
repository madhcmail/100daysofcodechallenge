	2. Call the search service via requests
	3. Verify the success of this
	4. Return basic dictionariesÂ and list the resulting titles
	5. Refactor the code using Named Tuples for search results 
	6. Once the results are displayed, ask the user if they want to view any of them and  use the  URL from the service response and open the users default browser to that page (Web browser library can be used to achieve this). \
Day 50: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I learned about bs4(BeautifulSoup) module for web scrapping in python and then I did practice by scrapping Fox News site and try to get all the news headlines. With just a single line of code we can get all the headlines. It's super fun and interesting!. \

I was able to pull only 1 page data from the API and trying to explore to get more search results. Will continues to work on this tomorrow.
Here is my GitHub link for today's code https://github.com/madhcmail/100daysofcodechallenge/blob/master/explore_apis/pull_tmdb_movies.py \
Day 64:#100DaysOfCode progress: Today I am still working on writing the movie metadata results of multiple API calls in to json file. I am facing issues while doing so.. Will continue working on it tomorrow. \
Day 65: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I finally able to pull the movie metadata results of multiple API calls in to json file. The key here is we need to properly understand the data before pulling it. I Will analyze the data that I pulled into a file tomorrow.\
Day 66:#100DaysOfCode progress: Today I tried to pull the required attributes like title, overview, release date, popularity, etc.. from the movie metadata API.\
Day67:#100DaysOfCode progress: Today I started learning on python Flask  to create apps.I have created a virtual environment and installed Flask module and created a simple application. Will learn more about this in the next couple of days.\
Day68:Today I decided to do a small project using Flask framework like creation of Blog page to understand the complete flow of this micro web framework. I am learning the basic on this and parallelly started setting the initial setup for this blog creation. The next couple of days will work on this Blog creation using Flask.
Here is my today's commit
