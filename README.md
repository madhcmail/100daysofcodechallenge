Day 12: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I continued to explored more on different options to run the pytest module, run only specific sub test cases , run using substrings, how to parametrize.\
Day 13: Today I started learning about object oriented programing. How to write classes, how to create instances, accessing the attributes and methods.\
Day 14: Today I continued learning more on classes, inheritance and overriding methods. Extended my yesterday's code with these new concepts.\

Day 16: Today I worked on a code challenge in Hacker Rank https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/word-order/problem. \
Day 17: Today I learned about  List comprehensions and how to write them. Practiced these by working on a most common words in a text file.\
Day 18: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I learned about python generators,  practiced on  list comprehensions, and finished PyBite code challenge https://codechalleng.es/bites/5/
Day 19: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I worked on dictionary comprehensions
Day 20: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I started working on Regular Expression which is very important module. This is required for me to learn before I solve by yesterday's code challenge https://pybit.es/codechallenge11.html which is on advanced generators.\
Day 21: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I continued my learning on regex and practiced on how to parse text using some useful regex methods and quantifiers.\
Day 22: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I did more practice on the regex character sets,custom character sets and quantifiers.\
Day 23: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I learnt about few more methods in regex like compile, finditer, groups.\
Day 24: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today Ihave completed the code challenge on converting unix pipeline to python using generators and regular expressions  https://pybit.es/codechallenge11.html.\
Day 25: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I started learning about itertools module and did some practice on the methods like cycle,product, permutations and combinations.\
Day 26: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I worked on creating a Traffic lights script using itertools and cycle method.\
Day 27: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I worked on some code challenges related to itertools module.Here are the code challenges\
Day 28: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I learned about four different ways of passing arguments to  functions.https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/style/#function-arguments \
Day 29: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I started learning about decorators in python and the syntax of decorators. Will learn more about these in next couple of days. \
Day 30: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I learned about Types of decorators like basic decorators, decorator function with single parameter, multiple parameters and how to pass a parameter to decorator. \
Day 31: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I learned about how to stack multiple decorators, and how to undecorate or use the original function from a decorated one. \
Day 32: Today I followed a link on decorators https://gist.github.com/Zearin/2f40b7b9cfc51132851a and solved https://codechalleng.es/bites/22/ \
Day 33: Today I learned about how to handle errors in python and did some parctice on error handling with try and except blocks.\
Day 34:#100DaysOfCode progress: Today I learned about logging in python and how to log different levels of information using python logging module. \
Day 35:#100DaysOfCode progress: Today I learned more about logging and practiced on loggers, file handlers and formatters \
Day 36: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I worked on solving a code challenge in hacker rank
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/validating-credit-card-number/problem \
Day 37: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I started learning about CSV module by parsing through a US weather dataset from fivethirtyeight github repository(https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data). Will continue working on this dataset on how to convert the csv data in to some usable form and find answers to some questions like top hottest, coldest, wettest days. 
Day 38:#100DaysOfCode progress: Today I continued my work on the US weather dataset that I picked from FiveThirtyEight GitHub repository(https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data). I wrote a function to convert the string data to the respective data types which will be used later for the analysis purpose. Also, I converted the dictionary to a named tuple which will help to work with the data in a more nicer way.\
Day 39: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I completed my code on the US weather dataset that I picked from FiveThirtyEight GitHub repository(https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data). I was able to parse the datset,convert into usable format and then find answers to the top 5 hottest days, coldest and wettest days. By analyzing this dataset, I am able to understand the CSV module, importance of named tuples and __file__ dunder variable.
