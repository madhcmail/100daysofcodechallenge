Day 1: #100DaysOfCode progress: today I worked on Playing with Datetimes \
Day 2: #100DaysOfCode progress: today I worked on practicing with timedelta and solved code bite challenge on "Parsing dates from logs" https://codechalleng.es/bites/7/. \
Day 3: #100DaysOfCode progress: today I worked on creating a Pomodoro timer app.\
Day 4: #100DaysOfCode progress: today I worked on Collections module \
Day 5: #100DaysOfCode progress: today I practiced more on Collections module. Took a movie dataset and practiced on it.\
Day 6: #100DaysOfCode progress: today I worked on how to parse CSV files using writer, reader and DictReader methods, and played around with my movie rating dataset. \
Day 7: #100DaysOfCode progress: The next couple of days I will be working on python data structures.Today I refreshed my skills on how to parse lists, tuples and dictionaries.\
Day 8: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I continued my work on python data structures by solving the PyBites code challenge https://codechalleng.es/bites/21/ \
Day 9: #100DaysOfCode progress: somemore  practice on python data structures Dits and lists.\
Day 10:#100DaysOfCode progress: Pytest practice-1 \
Day 11:#100DaysOfCode progress: Today I wrote #coding test cases using pytest module for the code challenge that I did on day8- Query a nested data structure.\
Day 12: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I continued to explored more on different options to run the pytest module, run only specific sub test cases , run using substrings, how to parametrize.\
Day 13: Today I started learning about object oriented programing. How to write classes, how to create instances, accessing the attributes and methods.\
Day 14: Today I continued learning more on classes, inheritance and overriding methods. Extended my yesterday's code with these new concepts.\
Day 15: Today I wrote Guess Randaom number game.\
Day 16: Today I worked on a code challenge in Hacker Rank https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/word-order/problem. \
Day 17: Today I learned about  List comprehensions and how to write them. Practiced these by working on a most common words in a text file.\
Day 18: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I learned about python generators,  practiced on  list comprehensions, and finished PyBite code challenge https://codechalleng.es/bites/5/
Day 19: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I worked on dictionary comprehensions
Day 20: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I started working on Regular Expression which is very important module. This is required for me to learn before I solve by yesterday's code challenge https://pybit.es/codechallenge11.html which is on advanced generators.\
Day 21: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I continued my learning on regex and practiced on how to parse text using some useful regex methods and quantifiers.\
Day 22: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I did more practice on the regex character sets,custom character sets and quantifiers.\
Day 23: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I learnt about few more methods in regex like compile, finditer, groups.\
Day 24: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today Ihave completed the code challenge on converting unix pipeline to python using generators and regular expressions  https://pybit.es/codechallenge11.html.\
Day 25: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I started learning about itertools module and did some practice on the methods like cycle,product, permutations and combinations.\
Day 26: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I worked on creating a Traffic lights script using itertools and cycle method.\
Day 27: #100DaysOfCode progress: Today I worked on some code challenges related to itertools module.Here are the code challenges
